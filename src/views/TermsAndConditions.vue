        <h2>Membership &amp; subscription</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to become a member of MENTOR.GG, you can choose between different
          membership plans. Please check the list of membership plans to find out
          which plans are available and what they contain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the membership, MENTOR.GG grants you access to certain benefits
          of the MENTOR.GG website. Benefits include access to additional analytics
          features and fewer limitations regarding the download or upload of data.
          Those benefits are subject to change as the development of the service
          progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The membership is tied to your steam account. A membership is not

        </p>
        <h2>Prices and Discounts</h2>
        <p>
          All prices consist of the net amount of the product (the membership), minus
          a possible discount, and if applicable, of the Value Added Tax of the home
          country of the purchaser. The costs are determined by the extent and
          duration of the chosen membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          The for the purchaser valid Value Added Tax will be shown in the order form
          together with the resulting total amount charged after entering all data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer discounts for our MENTOR.GG memberships on various occasions.
          These discounts are activated via a coupon code, which must be entered in
          the corresponding field (coupon code) BEFORE the purchase of the
          membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          MENTOR.GG, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
          Membership fees for the Membership. Any Membership fee change will
          become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          MENTOR.GG will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
          Membership fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Membership
          before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the Membership fee change comes
          into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Membership fee
          amount.

          received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of
          the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery
          other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us),
          without undue delay and in any event not later than 30 days from the day on
          which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract.
          We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you
          used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed

          reimbursement.

          by both parties on explicit request of the customer and has been completely
          fulfilled before the customer has exercised his right of withdrawal.
